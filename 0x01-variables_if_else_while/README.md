# Project: Low-Level Programming

## Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing

The first task involved writing a program in C that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it's executed and then prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. The program passed all checks successfully, and the results are as expected.

## Task 1: The last digit

In this task, we wrote a C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints the last digit of that number. Again, the program passed all checks successfully.

## Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia...

For this task, we created a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in a single line using only the `putchar` function. This program also met the requirements and successfully printed the alphabet.

## Task 3: alphABET

Task 3 required us to write a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet followed by the uppercase alphabet, all in a single line using only the `putchar` function. This task was successfully completed as well.

## Task 4: When I was having that alphabet soup...

In this task, we wrote a C program to print the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', all in a single line using only the `putchar` function. The program passed all checks and excluded 'q' and 'e' as required.

## Task 5: Numbers

Task 5 involved writing a C program to print all single-digit numbers in base 10 on a single line using only the `putchar` function. The program passed all checks successfully.

## Task 6: Numberz

For this task, we created a C program that prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 on a single line using only the `putchar` function and without using the `char` type. The program was completed as per the requirements.

## Task 7: Smile in the mirror

Task 7 required us to write a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse on a single line using only the `putchar` function. The program successfully printed the alphabet in reverse order.

## Task 8: Hexadecimal

In this task, we wrote a C program to print all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase on a single line using only the `putchar` function. The program met all requirements and printed the expected output.

## Task 9: Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

Task 9 involved writing a C program to print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas and spaces. The program successfully printed these combinations in ascending order.

## Task 10: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials...

For this advanced task, we wrote a C program to print all possible different combinations of two-digit numbers separated by spaces and commas. The combinations were printed in ascending order, with numbers printed with two digits.

## Task 11: The success combination in business is...

Task 11 required us to write a C program that prints all possible different combinations of three-digit numbers separated by spaces and commas. The combinations were printed in ascending order, and the program met all requirements.

## Task 12: Software is eating the World

In the final advanced task, we wrote a C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by spaces and commas. The combinations were printed in ascending order, and the program successfully met all requirements.

## Tasks

### Task 0: What's my name

A C function that prints a name using a function pointer. Two example functions, `print_name_as_is` and `print_name_uppercase`, are provided to demonstrate the use of function pointers.

### Task 1: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done

A C function that executes a given function on each element of an array using function pointers.

### Task 2: To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities

A C function that searches for an integer in an array using a comparison function provided as a function pointer.

### Task 3: A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at

A C program that performs simple operations (+, -, *, /, %) on two integers based on user input. It uses function pointers to select the appropriate operation.

### Task 4: Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker

An advanced task involving a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function in hexadecimal format.

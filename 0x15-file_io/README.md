# ALX Low-Level Programming - File I/O Tasks

This repository contains a series of C programming tasks related to file I/O operations. These tasks are part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum and cover various aspects of working with files and file descriptors in the C programming language.

## Task List

### Task 0: Tread lightly, she is near (read_textfile)

**Description:** Write a function that reads a text file and prints its contents to the standard output.

- Prototype: `ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters);`
- Returns the actual number of letters it could read and print.
- Returns 0 if the file cannot be opened or read.
- Returns 0 if `filename` is NULL.
- Returns 0 if the `write` operation fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes.

### Task 1: Under the snow (create_file)

**Description:** Create a function that creates a file with specified content.

- Prototype: `int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);`
- Returns 1 on success, -1 on failure.
- The file should have permissions `rw-------`.
- If the file already exists, truncate it.
- Returns -1 if `filename` is NULL.
- If `text_content` is NULL, create an empty file.

### Task 2: Speak gently, she can hear (append_text_to_file)

**Description:** Write a function that appends text to the end of a file.

- Prototype: `int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);`
- Returns 1 on success and -1 on failure.
- Does not create the file if it does not exist.
- Returns -1 if `filename` is NULL.
- If `text_content` is NULL, does not add anything to the file.

### Task 3: cp (Copy File)

**Description:** Write a program that copies the content of one file to another.

- Usage: `cp file_from file_to`
- If the number of arguments is incorrect, exit with code 97 and display usage information.
- If `file_to` already exists, truncate it.
- If `file_from` does not exist or cannot be read, exit with code 98 and display an error message.
- If the write operation to `file_to` fails, exit with code 99 and display an error message.
- If you cannot close a file descriptor, exit with code 100 and display an error message.
- Permissions of the created file: `rw-rw-r--`.

### Task 100: elf (Display ELF Header)

**Description:** Write a program that displays information from the ELF header of an ELF file.

- Usage: `elf_header elf_filename`
- Displays information such as Magic, Class, Data, Version, OS/ABI, ABI Version, Type, and Entry point address.
- Uses a format similar to `readelf -h`.
- Exits with status code 98 and displays an error message if the file is not an ELF file or on error.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the programs for each task, follow the provided compilation and usage instructions in the individual task folders.

## Requirements

- All files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific compiler flags.
- Follow the Betty style guide for code formatting.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Use only allowed C standard library functions and syscalls.
- Include a README.md file at the root of each task folder.

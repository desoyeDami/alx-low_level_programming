- [0-holberton.c](./0-holberton.c): This file contains a C program that prints "Holberton" followed by a new line. The program returns 0 when executed.

- [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c): This file includes a C function `void print_alphabet(void)` that prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line. The `_putchar` function is used within the code.

- [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c): Inside this file, there's a C function `void print_alphabet_x10(void)` that prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each followed by a new line. The `_putchar` function is used as well.

- [3-islower.c](./3-islower.c): This file contains a C function `int _islower(int c)` that checks if a character is lowercase. It returns 1 if the character is lowercase and 0 otherwise.

- [4-isalpha.c](./4-isalpha.c): Inside this file, there's a C function `int _isalpha(int c)` that checks if a character is an alphabetic character. It returns 1 if the character is alphabetic and 0 if it's not.

- [5-sign.c](./5-sign.c): This file contains a C function `int print_sign(int n)` that prints the sign of a number (positive, zero, or negative). It returns 1 for positive numbers, 0 for zero, and -1 for negative numbers.

- [6-abs.c](./6-abs.c): Inside this file, there's a C function `int _abs(int n)` that computes the absolute value of an integer.

- [7-print_last_digit.c](./7-print_last_digit.c): This file includes a C function `int print_last_digit(int n)` that prints the last digit of a number. It returns the last digit as an integer.

- [8-24_hours.c](./8-24_hours.c): Inside this file, there's a C function `void jack_bauer(void)` that prints every minute of the day (24 hours).

- [9-times_table.c](./9-times_table.c): This file contains a C function `void times_table(void)` that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

- [10-add.c](./10-add.c): Inside this file, there's a C function `int add(int a, int b)` that adds two integers and returns the result.

- [11-print_to_98.c](./11-print_to_98.c): This file includes a C function `void print_to_98(int n)` that prints all natural numbers from `n` to 98.

These files and tasks are part of the ALX SE project. They are designed to practice C programming concepts, functions, and conditional statements.
